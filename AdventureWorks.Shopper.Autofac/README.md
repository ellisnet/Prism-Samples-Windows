## AdventureWorks UWP Sample

### Getting Started

This app uses an (included) api for it's back-end. The api [AdventureWorks.WebServices](AdventureWorks.WebServices) must be running for the app to work.  It's configured to use IISExpress but will work with IIS as well (using localhost on port 2112).

1. Start the website
1. Select x86 or x64 (to run on your local machine)
1. Select AdventureWorks.Shopper from the list of projects
1. Select Local Machine and start the app.

If you get the app error "Service is unreachable" make sure the api is running by visiting [http://localhost:2112](http://localhost:2112)
